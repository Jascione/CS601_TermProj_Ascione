<p>These are our pets, Cooper and Molly. Cooper is a standard Poodle who is just 
    shy of two years old and Molly is our Himalayan Cat who just turned 10. For the most part they get 
    along as well as a cat and a dog can be expected. Cooper wants to play 24/7 and Molly 
    is all about being lazy with just enough inquisitiveness to taunt Cooper every so often. Something I learned
    about poodles when we bought Cooper is that they are large breed dogs, are very athletic 
    and were bred to be water hunting dogs. This means Cooper needs plenty of outside time and
    luckily, we have a big enough yard and we put in an invisible fence to keep him safe but also 
    give him the freedom to run around.
